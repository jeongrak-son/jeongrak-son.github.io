    <h1>Film Reviews</h1>

    <section class="intro">
        <p>For a long time, I have been enamoured with art and the community around it—artists express themselves so eloquently, and new sensations and ideas that I hadn't even imagined are created every day. Penetrating the art scene seemed like a formidable task, so instead, I chose to appreciate all the great things alone in my room, where I don't have to face my insecurities. I don't know why I've changed my mind recently, but here I am, sharing less confident pieces of my life. I don't expect many art connoisseurs to land on a physics student's portfolio website anyway.</p>
        
        <p>Of all the different media I love, cinema is dearest to my heart and the one I feel most comfortable talking about. Some pieces are more polished, as I've written them for other venues (mostly the NTU film society), while others are simply me rambling about films and collecting sentences I liked from other professional reviews. Updates will be slow and irregular—most of my time is dedicated to physics and my writing process is rather slow. But I'll do my best to keep this page alive. It also won't be very organised; I'll put published pieces, works in progress, and even ones I'm planning to write, all mixed together without much structure.</p>

        <p>I’m not really sure what the value of my writing is. It probably won’t offer new insights about films, and it’s definitely not as well-written as other reviews (seriously, I always feel like the worst writer in the NTU Film Society when I read other students’ work). If you’re reading this, I can only think of one reason: you love me and want to understand me better. So, thank you for that! I hope you like this version of me too.</p>

        <h2><em>Summer Hours</em> (2008) by Olivier Assayas</h2>
        <details>
        <summary>Read More</summary>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.ntufilmsociety.com/exposure/summer-hours-and-what-follows-after" target="_blank">“Summer Hours”, and What Follows After</a> published in Exposure, NTU film society's in-house publication</em></p>
        <p>This is the first film review I've ever wrote and it was an assignment for the first session of the NTU film society's film criticism lab. Summer Hours isn't my favourite film or anything, but it was what I happened to watch a week before the assignment.</p> 
        <p>For me, Assayas always symbolises maturity and refinement, almost synonymous to French chic. Summer Hours felt like the most mature of his films that I've watched: Irma Vep (1996), Clouds of Sils Maria (2014), etc. These films may not be revolutionary or ground-breaking, but they're certainly refreshing to watch after being exposed to all the buffoonery in our world. If you're curious, check out the film (and maybe my review in Exposre)!</p>
