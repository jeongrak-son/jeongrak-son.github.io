            <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">Researcher (Project Officer)</h2>
            <p>Hi! I am a theoretical physicist working on quantum information, quantum algorithms, and quantum thermodynamics. Currently, I am based at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, as part of the <a href="https://www.nellyng.com/" target="_blank">In.Q group</a> led by Nelly Ng.</p>
            
            <p>During my PhD, I focused on the usage of auxiliary systems (viz. all systems participating in the process other than the main system of interest) in information processing. One part of my PhD work is an attempt to understand and characterise the power of catalytic usage of auxiliaries, i.e. auxiliary systems that return to their original state at the end. Another part develops how to use auxiliaries as memories, and in particular, how to use them without reading them first. I have also developed a family of quantum algorithms that can solve non-linear differential equations and can be improved by quantum memories. Check out my full list of publications in the Publications tab.</p>

            <p>I am starting to broaden my research interests to state-based quantum algorithms, general resource theories, and quantum state complexity. If you are interested in collaborating with me, leave me a message in the Contact tab.</p>

            <p>Besides physics, I am very passionate about films. To see my four favourites, check out my <a href="https://boxd.it/3bn2z" target="_black">Letterboxd profile</a>. To read my film reviews (published and unpublished) check out the Film Reviews tab.</p>
